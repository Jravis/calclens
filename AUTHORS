All of the code in CALCLENS was written by myself (Matthew R. Becker)
over a period of three years starting in the winter of 2009 through
the fall of 2012. Development has been continuing past the fall of 
2012 through 2014. However there are three important exceptions.

1) Most of the HEALPix routines (http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/)
have been modified and translated from C++ and F90 to C under the GNU
GPL v2. I have made every attempt to retain the original copyrights
where appropriate and to note the changes I made to the routines,
though I am sure that there is code I have added which was not noted
properly. I have also added quite a bit of new functionality to them
as well.  

2) CALCLENS uses a hypercube parallel communication scheme, the
implementation of which used here was originally by Volker Springel and copied
from Gadget-2 (http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/gadget/) under GNU GPL
v2. I have made every attempt to place a notice in the code where this
algorithm is used. Also, some of the M-to-N I/O, array reordering, restart I/O
routines were inspired by Gadget-2 as well.

3) The structure of the Makefile follows that of Gadget-2, copied
under the same license as 2) above.

I would like to thank Andrey Kravtsov, Tom Abel, Eduardo Rozo, Wayne
Hu, Risa Wechsler, Michael Busha, Gus Evrard, Doug Rudd and the DES
weak lensing and cluster working groups for their comments and
suggestions which vastly improved this work. Several people tested and
used early versions of the shear fields including Joerg Dietrich, Tim
Eifler and Alexie Leauthaud.  Their assistance and patience is most
appreciated. I would also like to thank Doug Rudd, Stuart Marshall and
Valeri Galtsev for their assistance with various compute clusters. I
am additionally grateful to Volker Springel for publicly releasing
Gagdet-2.
